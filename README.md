# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
Visualize has given you and Omar a brand-new assignment. Using your Python skills and knowledge of Pandas, you’ll create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. Then, using Pandas and Matplotlib, you’ll create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Finally, you’ll submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results:

  * In the chart above the rural, suburban, and urban city types driver count correlates to the total number of rides and total fares. In the large urban area with 2405 drivers, the most, we would expect the ride count and total fares per city type to also be the largest as it is. Suburban city type is the next largest driver count and ride count then again with the second most total fares. Rural being the smallest for driver count, ride count, and total fares. Although rural city type is the smallest number of drivers and ride counts the average price per ride and per driver are greater in rural areas than the larger suburban city type and even larger city type urban.  
  * In the line graph below you can see the total fares by city type from the dates 01/01/2019-04/29/2019.

## Summary:

Three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types. 
  * In the rural city type averages per ride and per driver could be greater compared to other city types due to the length and duration of the trip in the rural area resulting in a higher average fare per ride per driver in the rural areas. More information about rural rides could provide more insght. 
  * Urban city types have the lowest averages fare per ride and per driver. Also in the urban city type we have more drivers than rides, this can result in competitive pricing making it not as profitable to be a driver in an urban area. Finding a good ratio of drivers to rides needed would be better for urual drivers.
  * Adding more drivers to rual and suburban city types could change the average fares per driver and ride to even out across the ctiy types. This also might have an increase in total fares per city type.
